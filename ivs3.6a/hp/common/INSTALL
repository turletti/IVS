concerning the audio part. Please read the README file.

Only 3 platforms are available for this version:

- iris5.3 (for SGI - IRIS 5.3 GALILEO/INDIGO/VINO VIDEO platforms)
- sun4OS4 (for SunOS4.x - PARALLAX/VIDEOPIX/VIGRAPIX platforms)
- sun4OS5 (for SunOS5.x - PARALLAX/SUNVIDEO/VIDEOPIX/VIGRAPIX platforms)

All compressed files contain manual pages and README files.
Sources files and Makefiles for all platforms are included in
