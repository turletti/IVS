I. INTRODUCTION

This is a software implementation of the INRIA VIDEOCONFERENCE SYSTEM, in a
"standard" environment, under UNIX, X-WINDOWS and using Motif 1.1 toolkit.
The video coder uses the simple video capture board "VideoPix" provided by 
SUN for the SparcStation. (its original name was "videoconf")
-- The ADPCM codecs are based on Jack Jansen's codec (Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl).
See manual page.

II. TESTING IVS

First set XENVIRONMENT variable to the file ivs.ad or add these
variables to your .Xdefaults file.
Check that DISPLAY variable is set (jerry:0 for example).

Then, run ivs

ivs -o -t 64, for example (multicast option, original
format, and ttl=64)

ivs jerry.inria.fr ; (another example with unicast option.)

Grey colors mean the choice selected. If you want to change parameters,
click on your new choice and it'll be selected for the next encoding video.
When you click on "Start Encoding Video", the encoding starts, and the menu
"Video Encoding" disappears until you click on "Stop Encoding Video".

IP address multicast is set by default to 224.8.8.8
The stations on the same IP address will be automatically seen. Several control
packets are sent (Declaration, Information required, End ), you only need
to select your audio(s) decoding and video(s) decoding station(s).

If you have VideoPix hardware and a camera, you are able to encode
your video. Else, only video decoding and audio codec is possible.

If you ftp & use this codec, you can send all remarks or modifications made to
