+ Resolve the problem which appeared using the IP_MULTICAST_IF option. Now the
  -ni option should also select the right network interface for the sending
  socket. (thanks to Francis Dupont).

+ decode_h261 crashed (bug fixed)

+ In DEC and Linux platforms, the connect() call to the video source in 
multicast mode does not work. This call has been removed in these platforms.

* Added  the default following X resources to ivs.ad.
	"*MyHostName.foreground:           Black",
        "*HostName.foreground:           Black",

* Added GSM audio coding. The coder used has been written by Jutta Degener and 
  Carsten Bormann, Technische Universitaet Berlin and modified for use in ivs 
  by Andres Vega from INRIA.

* Added LPC audio coding. The coder used has been written from Ron Zuckerman (
  ronzu@isu.comm.mot.com) of Motorola and modified by Ron Frederick 
  (frederic@parc.xerox.com) from Xerox PARC. (Note that the quality obtained
  is very bad).

* Added redundancy in the audio packets. Now, the Audio Panel includes now 
  options to choose the type of redundancy contained in each packet sent. The 
  redundancy is obtained by adding at each packet information concerning the 
  previous packet sent. This is currently manually done but this function 
  will be selected automatically by the congestion control algorithm in a 
  future version of ivs. The work has been done by Hugues Devries and 
  Andres Vega from INRIA.
