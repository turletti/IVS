IVS version 3.6a (95/7/13)

* Included the changes concerning security functions from Ian Wakeman (UCL).
  IVS and VIC should now cooperate...

* Fixed a bug in the audio selection menu which mixed up the audio coding 
  format.

* Recompile the solaris binary on a Solaris 2.3 to build a version with 
  the static xil library. It seems static xil libraries are not avalaible
  on Solaris 2.4 (at least on my platform). Does any SUN guru know anything
  about this ?
