.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ivsd
[

]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B ivsd
is a server used by the 
.B ivs
application. It listens at the tcp port 2241. When you run it, a
small icon appears. When a remote ivs request is received, the
icon will change, and a message 
will pop up showing you the ivs caller. At this point, you only
need to click on \fIAccept\fR button to start the ivs call.

If you click on the ivs icon, you will be able to initiate an ivs session
in unicast or multicast mode.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP 
.TP 10
.B \-autoreply
Set the automatic reply mode. In this mode, as soon as a call
request is received, an ivs is run and video is sent automatically
with the defaults parameters. Note that this mode should be used with
extrem cautions to avoid spying problems...
.SH NOTES
.LP
The ivs program must be visible by the PATH environment variable.
A log file \fI.ivsd.log\fR contains a log of all ivs calls received.
